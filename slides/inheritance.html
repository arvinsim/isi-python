                <h4>What is Inheritance?</h4>
            </section>

            <section>
                <blockquote>Inheritance is the practice of passing on property, titles, debts, rights and obligations upon the death of an individual.
                </blockquote>
            </section>

            <section>Not really the best definition to use</section>

            <section>Let's try again, this time in biology using the definition of heredity</section>

            <section>
                <blockquote>Heredity is the passing of traits from parents to their offspring. You can say that the offspring inherits the traits from the parents.</blockquote>
            </section>

            <section>Much better and closer to the concept that we want</section>

            <section>Finally, the definition of inheritance in programming, paraphrased for simplicity</section>

            <section>
                <blockquote>Inheritance is when a class will get or inherit some of its implementation from other class or classes. This includes attributes and methods.</blockquote>

        <section>
            <section>We already have discussed how to override attributes and methods.</section>
            <section>However, sometimes we don't want the child class to override the some of the parent's methods.</section>
            <section>We might want to reuse those methods because they can still help.</section>
            <section>In that case, we want to "extend" the class</section>
        </section>

        <section>
            <section>To extend a class, we need to use the super() built-in function</section>
            <section>The super() built-in function allows us to call attributes and methods from the parent in the child class</section>
            <section>Here is the typical way the super() built-in function is used.</section>
            <section>
                <pre><code>
    class Parent(object):
        def method(self, arg):
            print "This is the arg: {}".format(arg)

    class Child(Parent):
        def method(self, arg):
            arg = "{}(called by Child)".format(arg)
            super(Child, self).method(arg)
                </code></pre>
            </section>

            <section>Let's breakdown the relevant code</section>

            <section>
                <pre><code>
    # super(Child, self) evaluates to the parent class
    # (which is named Parent)

    # super(Child, self).method(arg) calls the method named
    # "method" in the Parent Class

            <section><em>What happens when a child's parents have similar attributes and/or methods?</em></section>

            <section>Python uses an algorithm called Method Resolution Order(MRO) to decided which attribute or methods
            get priority</section>

            <section>MRO is a complicated algorithm. It takes an <a href="https://www.python.org/download/releases/2.3/mro/">long article</a> to explain it in its entirety!</section>

            <section><img src="http://rs1img.memecdn.com/ain-amp-039-t-nobody-got-time-for-that_o_1582005.jpg" alt="Nobody ain't got time for that"/></section>

            <section>Fortunately, there is a way to circumvent MRO entirely and explicitly define which parent we are referring to.</section>

            <section>
                <p>We do this by using the baseclass syntax</p>
                <pre><code>
    # baseclass is the name of the parent class

    # attribute refers to the method you want to
    # access in the parent class
    baseclass.attribute

    # method refers to the method you want to
    # access in the parent class
    baseclass.method()
                </code></pre>
            </section>

            <section>Here is an example demonstrating how to use baseclass</section>

            <section>
                <pre><code>
    class Father(object):
        eye_color = 'blue'

        def get_personality_type(self):
            return 'extrovert'

    class Mother(object):
        eye_color = 'green'

        def get_personality_type(self):
            return 'introvert'

    class Child(Father, Mother):
        eye_color = Father.eye_color

        def get_personality_type(self):
            # NOTE: you need to pass self as the first argument
            # to call the base class method using the 'baseclass'
            # style
            return Mother.get_personality_type(self)

    c = Child()
    print c.eye_color
    print c.get_personality_type()
                </code></pre>

            <section>
                <p>To recap:</p>
                <blockquote>use super() for single/multilevel inheritance, baseclass.method() for multiple inheritance</blockquote>

                <p>A word of caution</p>
            </section>

            <section>Multiple inheritance is a very powerful feature</section>
            <section>However, this kind of inheritance is complex and error prone.</section>
            <section>This is especially true if you are using multiple inheritance with many classes</section>
            <section>
                <p>You should always ask yourself if you can implement what you had in mind using single or multilevel inheritance</p>
                <p>Because there's almost always a alternative solution that doesn't involve using multiple inheritance.</p>
