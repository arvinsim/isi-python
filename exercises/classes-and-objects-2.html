# Another Round of Classes and Objects Exercises
---

# Basic Category

---

##  1. Rectangle

Create a `Rectangle` class where it should

+ have a constructor where I can pass the `width` and `length`
+ have a `get_area()` method
+ have a `get_perimeter()` method

Create 2 `Rectangle` objects with different `width` and `length`

### Tip:
1. Perimeter is calculated as the sum of twice the width and twice the length.
2. Area is calculated as the product of the width and length.
---

## 2. Song

Create a `Song` class where it should

+ have these attributes
    + `name`
    + `artist`
    + `album`
    + `year`
    + `length`

+ when printed, should output a string in this format (use `__repr__`)

```
=========================
Name: Jack Sparrow
Artist: The Lonely Island feat. Michael Bolton
Album: Turtleneck and Chain
Year: 2011
Length: 3:07
=========================
```

Create 3 `Song` objects from it

---

## 3. Paragraphs

paragraph = 'Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet, consectetur adipiscing elit, sed do eiusmod tempor incididunt ut labore et dolore magna aliqua. Ut enim ad minim veniam, quis nostrud exercitation ullamco laboris nisi ut aliquip ex ea commodo consequat. Duis aute irure dolor in reprehenderit in voluptate velit esse cillum dolore eu fugiat nulla pariatur. Excepteur sint occaecat cupidatat non proident, sunt in culpa qui officia deserunt mollit anim id est laborum.'

Create a `Paragraph` object from the string above that should

+ a list attribute of all the words in the paragraph (excluding punctuation)
+ a dictionary attribute containing each unique word and its corresponding word count
+ a string attribute that contains the most frequent word in the paragraph
+ methods to generate the above attributes
    + `get_words()`
    + `get_dictionary_of_words()`
    + `get_most_frequent_word`

---

## 4. Palindrome

1. Define class Palindrome() that accept a string parameter. In your initialiser/constructor method, create an instance variable called "word".
2. Define method reverse() that accepts a string parameter and returns the reverse that string
3. Define class is_palindrome(). This method check if the string specified on the instance variable "word" is a palindrome. This method returns a boolean result and should utilise the reverse() method defined.

```
p1 = Palindrome("Dammit, I'm mad!")
print p1.is_palindrome() # False

p1.word = 'radar'
print p1.is_palindrome() # True
```

## 1. Tale of 2 Rockets

1. Define a class named `Rocket` that accept an optional x,y position.
2. Define `move_rocket()` method. This method accepts nothing but generates a random x,y position that adds up to the current x,y position values.
3. Define `get_distance()` method. The method should accept a Rocket object and then will calculate the distance between the current rocket instance and the rocket object that is passed using the Distance Formula:

```
	d = sqrt((x2 - x1)^2 + (y2 - y1)^2)
```

Create 2 `Rocket` object instances -- the first rocket object takes no arguments. Move the 2 rockets and calculate and print the distance between them.

Tips
-----------------------
1. use random.randrange from random (use `import random`) to generate each x, y value between 1 to 100
2. use math.sqrt from math to find the square root (use `import math`)

## 1. Coordinates

Create a Coordinate object with the following attributes

- x position
- y position

Implement it with a constructor passing the x and y values.

```
class Coordinate(object):
    ...

coordinate1 = Coordinate(1,2)
coordinate2 = Coordinate(2,3)
...
```

Implement the `__repr__` method so that when print out
a Coordinate object, it should output the x and y
values this way

```
"Coordinate(1,2)"
```

---

## 2. Person

Create a `Person` class with the following requirements

### Attributes(represented by `Coordinate` objects)

+ `current_position`
+ `destination`

### Methods

- `move_up()`
- `move_down()`
- `move_left()`
- `move_right()`
- constructor where you can set the `current_position` and `destination`

Then define a sequence of method calls on how to get to the destination.
The program should print out a message if it has arrived to its destination.

---

## Example:

NOTE: Computer Graphics assume that the (0,0) coordinate is on the top-left
not bottom-left as would we do in math.

[Example here](http://programarcadegames.com/chapters/05_intro_to_graphics/Computer_coordinates_2D.png)

```
start = Coordinate(0, 0)
destination = Coordinate(2, 2)

p = Person(start, destination) # current position is (0, 0)
p.move_right() # current position is (1, 0)
p.move_right() # current position is (2, 0)
p.move_down() # current position is (2, 1)
p.move_down() # current position is (2, 2)
```

I have arrived at my final destinatio....

---

## 3. Obstacle

Add an attribute that is a list of coordinates.

Coordinates should be represented by objects with x and y attributes.

```
class Coordinate(object):
    ...

coordinate1 = Coordinate(1,2)
coordinate2 = Coordinate(2,3)
...

self.obstacles = [ coordinate1, coordinate2, ... ]
```

This coordinates are the location of obstacles.

If the `Person` object tries to go into a coordinate that is occupied
by an obstacle, it should print out a message informing the user that it has ran
into an obstacle and should NOT move into that coordinate. It should just stay put.

It's up to you to define where the obstacles are but you need to define a sequence
of method calls in where the `Person` bumps into at least one obstacle

---

## Example:

Let's assume there is an obstacle at (2,1)

```
start = Coordinate(0, 0)
destination = Coordinate(2, 2)

p = Person(start, destination) # at (0, 0)
p.move_right() # try moving to (1,0), success, at (1,0)
p.move_right() # try moving to (2,0), success, at (2,0)
p.move_down() # try moving to (2,1), fail, at (2,0)
```

Person uses ram strike on obstacle.
It's super ineffective! The obstacle wins.

```
p.move_right() # try moving to (3,0), success, at (3,0)
p.move_down() # try moving to (3,1), success, at (3,1)
p.move_down() # try moving to (3,2), success, at (3,2)
p.move_left() # try moving to (2,2), success, at (2,2)
```

Person arrives at the destination still bruised.

---

## 4. Boundary

Create a `Boundary` object which contains

### Attributes

- x1
- x2
- y1
- y2

Which represents the four sides of the rectangle.

### Methods

- `is_out_of_bounds(c)`
    - accepts a `Coordinate` object
    - checks if the `Coordinate` is out of bounds

---

## 4. Boundary

Update the constructor of the `Person` object to accept a `Boundary` object as the 3rd parameter
and set it as an attribute of `Person`

When the `Person` tries to go out of bounds, it should act the same way as when it
would encounter an obstacle.

Define a sequence of method calls in where the `Person` tries to go out of bounds at least once.

---

## 5. Real Time Graphical Display

For every movement method call, it should display out the current map status

```
D = Destination
- = Empty Space
P = Player
O = Obstacle

Example:
- 5x5 map
- Obstacles are on (0,1), (1,1), (2,2)
- Destination is on (3,1)
- Player is on (1,3)
