<p>Requirements: Using global variables in solving these problems is NOT allowed.</p>
<h3 id="countleobject">CountLeObject</h3>
<p>Create a class <code>CountLeObject</code>. Then output the current number of objects of that class that was instantiated.</p>
<pre><code>a = CountLeObject()
print CountLeObject.ctr # 1

b = CountLeObject()
c = CountLeObject()
print CountLeObject.ctr # 3</code></pre>
<h3 id="simple-calculator">Simple Calculator</h3>
<p>Create a simple calculator class that does something below</p>
<pre><code>c = new Calculator(5)
c.add(1)
c.subtract(2)
c.multiply(3)
c.divide(4)
c.get_result() # The answer should be 3</code></pre>
<h3 id="phonebook">Phonebook</h3>
<p>Create 2 classes <code>Phonebook</code> and <code>Contact</code>. The <code>Contact</code> class should hold the name and phone number. The <code>Phonebook</code> should hold a list of contacts. Define these methods in <code>Phonebook</code>:</p>
<ul>
<li>A method that adds an entry to the contact list. The argument should be a dictionary with name and phone number</li>
<li>A method that removes an entry from the contact list based on the number</li>
<li>A method that gets an entry from a contact list based on the number</li>
<li>A method that prints out a list of all the contact entries</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="bdobangko-dhens-oro">BDO(Bangko Dhens Oro)</h3>
<p>Create a class named <code>Bank</code>. Define this methods</p>
<ul>
<li>A method to deposit</li>
<li>A method to withdraw</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="poker-hand">Poker Hand</h3>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li><p>Define 3 classes, <code>Deck</code>, <code>Card</code> and <code>Player</code> which represents a deck of cards, an individual card and a player respectively.

<li>Define a method for <code>Deck</code> named <code>deal_poker_hands</code> that:</li>
</ol>
<ul>
<li>accepts the number of players. The number of players should be 2 minimum, 8 maximum. If invalid number is passed, the function should print a message that says that the number is invalid instead of processing it.</li>
<li>returns a list of players with 2 random Card objects assigned to it. No two or more players should have the same card.</li>
</ul>
<p>NOTE: To generate a random from a specific range, add this code at the top of your file</p>
<pre><code>import random</code></pre>
<p>then use this method to generate random numbers</p>
<pre><code>random.randrange(1,10) # Get a random number between 1 to 10</code></pre>
