        <section>
            <h2>Hello World, Package Edition</h2>

            <section>
                <p>Create a package named "helloworld"</p>
                <p>This package should display the current date, time and the string "Import success!" upon import</p>
            </section>

            <h2>RO13</h2>

            <section>
                <p>
                    ROT13 ("rotate by 13 places", sometimes hyphenated ROT-13) is a simple letter substitution cipher that replaces a letter with the letter 13 letters after it in the alphabet. ROT13 is a special case of the Caesar cipher, developed in ancient Rome.
                </p>
            </section>

            <section>
                <p>In the basic Latin alphabet, ROT13 is its own inverse; that is, to undo ROT13, the same algorithm is applied, so the same action can be used for encoding and decoding. The algorithm provides virtually no cryptographic security, and is often cited as a canonical example of weak encryption.</p>

            <section>
                <h3>What to do</h3>
                <p>
                    Create a package named "lib". In the package, create a module named "functions". The module should contain the class named "ROT13". The class should take a string parameter, which is required and will be reversed as you assign it. Define a method called "render", this will then display the rotated string output. You should be able to create an algorithm to satisfy the ROT13 substitution cipher.
                </p>
            </section>

            <section>
                <h3>What to do</h3>
                <p>Name your main module as "rot13.py".</p>
            </section>

            <section>
                <h3>Sample Code</h3>
                <pre><code>
    r = ROT13('ehugen lnqugevo lccnu')
    r.render() # deciphered output
                </code></pre>
            </section>

                <p>
                    In basketball, a player’s statistics like points, rebounds, and assists are recorded for analysis. Since the typical basketball game is fast paced, they normally record what a player does (e.g. rebound, make an assist, miss a free throw) by simply listing each action in a single statline per player. At the end of the game, each player’s performance is
                    recorded by processing the player’s stats.
                </p>
            </section>

            <section>
                <p>For example, a player’s statline may look like this: 2XYRTXRA3YX012ARY</p>
            </section>

            <section>
                <p>The player’s statistics can then be determined using the following legend:</p>
                <table>

                        <th>

                        made one and missed three 3-pt shots

                    <li>
                        made two assists

                    <li>
                        caught three rebounds

                    <li>
                        committed one turnover

                <p>
                    You must create a program that will read the players’ statline from a text file and display out the statistics.
                </p>
            </section>

            <section>
                <h3>Input specifications</h3>
                <p>A simple text file shall be source of all input data, with the filename <a href="../assets/files/basketball.txt" target="_blank">basketball.txt</a></p>
            </section>

            <section>
                <h3>Input specifications</h3>
                <p>The input file contains several lines. Each line contains the player’s jersey number followed by a single space and then the player’s statline, as described in above stats example (see 2XYRTXRA3YX012ARY).</p>
            </section>

            <section>
                <h3>Output Specifications</h3>
                <p>The output should display the player's statline described above. The first line of each player’s statistics displays the jersey number of the player, preceded by the word "PLAYER". The second line shows the number of points preceded by the word "Points". </p>
            </section>

            <section>
                <h3>Output Specifications</h3>
                <p>
                    The next three lines will display the shooting percentages (preceded by "Freethrows", "“2-point shots", and "“3-point shots"), indented by a tab or four (4) spaces (whichever you prefer). The last three lines indicate the rest ("Assists", "Rebounds", "Turnovers").                </p>
                </p>
            </section>

            <section>
                <h3>What to do</h3>
                <p>Create two classes.</p>
            </section>

            <section>
                <h3>What to do</h3>
                <p>The <strong>Shot</strong> class will contain instance variables namely, "made" and "missed". This class will also need to make percentage calculations and will sum up the total shot attempts (made and missed). The class should make use of the object representation magic method (__repr__) to display the object output. You will also need the math function "ceil" specifically to compute the shot point percentage (use the "from X import Y" variation).
                </p>
            </section>

            <section>
                <h3>What to do</h3>
                <p>
                    The <strong>Basketball</strong> class is where the players statlines will be parsed based on the text file input provided. You will only need to provide the "display_stats" method to display the player statline. It would be up to your discretion to create the necessary methods to achieve the implementation. Again, the Basketball class could contain several methods as needed.
                </p>
            </section>

            <section>
                <h3>What to do</h3>
                <p>(<em>Optional</em>) To normalize the program, you can create several classes (ie, Shot, Stats, Player, Basketball) where the Shot and Basketball classes are required.</p>
                <p>This approach is recommended since it makes the logic easier to reason out.</p>
            </section>

            <section>
                <h3>Required lines of code to run the program</h3>
                <pre><code>
    b = Basketball('data/basketball.txt')
    b.display_stats()
                </code></pre>
            </section>

            <section>
                <h3>Output</h3>
                <pre><code>
    Sample input line from "basketball.txt"
