                <p>Up until now, we have been using the procedural programming.</p>
                <p>That is, we specify some steps to reach a desired state.</p>
                <p>We do this using local variables, iteration, etc.</p>

                <p>
                    Object-oriented programming (OOP) is a programming paradigm based on the concept of "objects",
                    which are data structures that contain data, in the form of fields, often known as attributes; and code, in the form of procedures, often known as methods.

                <p>That was a mouthful of words, let us translate that to something a layman can understand</p>

                <p>Arthur's Definition of OOP</p>
                <p>Object Oriented Programming is programming using "objects" in real life as an analogy. Objects has attributes and some can do some stuff</p>

            <h2>Objects</h2>
            <section></section>

            <section>
                + Objects are the heart and soul of Python
            </section>

            <section>
                <p>Objects can sometimes correspond to things found in the world.</p>
                <p>For example,</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>A graphics program may have objects such as "circle," "square," "menu".</li>
                    <li>An online shopping system might have objects such as "shopping cart," "customer," and "product."</li>
                </ul>
            </section>

            <section>
                <p>Sometimes objects represent more abstract entities, like an object that represents an open file,
                    or an object which provides the service of translating measurements from U.S. customary to metric.</p>
            </section>

            <section>
                + Objects have attributes

            <section></section>

            <section>
                <p>Classes are simply how you implement and apply the concept of objects.</p>
            </section>

            <section>
                <p>Think of classes as "blueprints" for your objects</p>
            </section>
        </section>

        <section>
            <h2>Defining a Class</h2>
            <section></section>

            <section>
                <p>Classes are defined by using the class keyword</p>
            </section>

            <section>
                + Class Example
                + Class example with properties
                + Empty class example
            </section>

            <section>
                <p>Just like functions, they do nothing by themselves.</p>

        <section>
            <h2>Classes and Objects</h2>
            <section></section>

            <section>
                <p>Now that we know how to define our classes or create our "blueprints", we can now move on to
                creating actual objects</p>
            </section>

            <section>
                <p>The term for creating an object is instantiation</p>
                <p>Creating an object == Instantiating an object</p>
            </section>

            <section>
                <p>When we instantiate, we create a new object. That new object is called an instance of the class you created it
                    from.</p>
            </section>

            <section>
                <p>Each instance is unique. It is separate from other instances.</p>
            </section>

            <section>
                <p>The type of an instance is that of its class. Basically, a class is its own datatype!</p>
