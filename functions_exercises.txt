1. Choose a song that you like. Using functions, divide that song to some logical divisions(chorus, verse, bridge, etc) and print out the whole lyrics of the song
without copy pasting the parts of the song that are repeated.


2. Define a procedure histogram() that takes a list of integers and prints a histogram to the screen. For example, histogram([4, 9, 7]) should print the following:
****
*********
*******

3. Define a function that draws a rectangle using asterisks, accepting a parameter that defines how many asterisks to draw for its width and height

draw_rectangle(1)

*

draw_rectangle(2)

**
**

draw_rectangle(3)
***
* *
***

draw_rectangle(10)
*********
*       *
*       *
*       *
*       *
*       *
*       *
*       *
*       *
*********

4. Define a function reverse() that computes the reversal of a string. For example, reverse("I am testing") should return the string "gnitset ma I”.
5. Define a function is_palindrome() that recognizes palindromes (i.e. words that look the same written backwards). For example, is_palindrome("radar") should return True.
6. Write a version of a palindrome recognizer that also accepts phrase palindromes such as "Go hang a salami I'm a lasagna hog.", "Was it a rat I saw?", "Step on no pets", "Sit on a potato pan, Otis", "Lisa Bonet ate no basil", "Satan, oscillate my metallic sonatas", "I roamed under it as a tired nude Maori", "Rise to vote sir", or the exclamation "Dammit, I'm mad!". Note that punctuation, capitalization, and spacing are usually ignored.

7. Write a function that takes a character (i.e. a string of length 1) and returns True if it is a vowel, False otherwise.
8. Write a function translate() that will translate a text into "rövarspråket" (Swedish for "robber's language").
 That is, double every consonant and place an occurrence of "o" in between. For example, translate("this is fun") should return the string "tothohisos isos fofunon".
