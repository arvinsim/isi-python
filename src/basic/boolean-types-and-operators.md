# Relational Operators

## Equal To
    
    >>> 100 == 100
    True
    >>> 100 == 50
    False
    >>> -100 == 100
    False
    >>> 100 == True
    False

# Not Equal To

    >>> 100 != 100
    False
    >>> 100 != 50
    True
    >>> -100 != 100
    True
    >>> 100 != True
    True

## Greater Than / Greater Than Equal To

    >>> 5 > 10
    False
    >>> 10 > 5
    True
    >>> 5 > 5
    False
    >>> 5 >= 5
    True

## Less Than

    >>> 5 < 10
    True
    >>> 10 < 5
    False
    >>> 5 < 5
    False
    >>> 5 <= 5
    True

# Trivia!

Any nonzero number is interpreted as "true"

>>> 0 and True
0
>>> 17 and True
True

This flexibility can be useful, but there are some subtleties to it that might be confusing. You might want to avoid it (unless you know what you are doing).
